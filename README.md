# pod_alert
Helps me determine if I'll ever get an open slot on Peapod

Requires:
Setting execution policy for windows
Setting necessary environment variables

Chrome does not work, Firefox is necessary here

Four environment variables are needed
PPUSER
PPPASS
OUTLOOKUSER
OUTLOOKPASS
RECEIVERS - for this one, enter in CSV format no spaces

Unfortunately, since I can't reserve a time, I can't emulate the functionality until a slot opens
